This Repository contains MATLAB codes for the implementation of the model for Predicting the classes of our input images Using Transfer Learning with AlexNet CNN

The proposed methods include transfer learning techniques using the popular pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN)

AlexNet from feature extraction down to classifying the output using the complete 25 layers in a pre-trained AlexNet CNN.


NOTE:

The Images Used are saved in a folder called xrayscan with two subfolders further categorized into three categories as our output classes.
