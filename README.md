# covid19

In this study, deep learning frameworks/models are proposed for the automatic diagnosis of Covid-19. The proposed models are developed to provide accurate diagnostics for a multi-class classification (Covid19 vs. Pneumonia vs. Normal) patients. 

Thus, this repository contains MATLAB codes for the implementation of the models proposed for Predicting the classes of our input images used in the study.
The proposed methods include transfer learning techniques using the popular pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multiclass classification using CNN
for feature extraction to fit a multiclass classifier to predict the classes as output.

These X-ray images are obtained from different sources which we used in the diagnosis of Covid-19. One of these sources is the porpularly known Covid-19 X-ray image database developed by Cohen JP PhD, which contains images from various open access repositories. 

Please see the research paper for more information on this study.


NOTE:
The Images Used are saved in a folder called xrayscan with two subfolders (Test, Training) further categorized into three categories (Covid19, Pneumonia, Normal) as our output classes.
